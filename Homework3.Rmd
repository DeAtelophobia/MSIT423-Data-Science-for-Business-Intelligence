```{r}
auto = read.table("http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Auto.data",
header=T, na.strings="?")
auto$origin = factor(auto$origin, 1:3, c("US", "Europe", "Japan"))
```
(a)

```{r}
fit = lm(mpg~weight+year+origin, auto)
summary(fit)
plot(fit)
```
(b) According to the diagnostic plots, the linear model is 

```{r}
fit2 = lm(log(mpg)~origin+log(weight)+year+I(year)^2,auto)
summary(fit2)
plot(fit2)
```
(c) As we can see, R square is high, so I think this model is beter than the previous one.

```{r}
fit3 <- lm(log(mpg)~year, auto)
summary(fit3)
plot(fit3)
plot(auto$mpg,auto$year)
```
(d) The effect of year on log(mpg) is linear;
